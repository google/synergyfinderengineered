This project is a fork of the 'synergyfinder' project, available in
github at https://github.com/hly89/synergyfinder, and also available
in BioConductor.  The code here was originally offered as a patch to
the main project, with some code clean-up, bug fixes, and unit tests.
The patch proved difficult to complete, so the code is offered here
instead.
